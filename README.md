# Crystals Collector
Fun and interactive game for web browsers utilizing jQuery to dynamically update HTML.

## Here's how the app works:
* There are four Billy Crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
* The player gets a random number between 19 and 120 at the start of the game.
* When the player clicks on a Crystal, it will add a specific amount of points, between 1 and 12, to the player's total score.
* This amount is hidden until the player clicks a Crystal.
* When they do click one, the player's score counter is updated.
* The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
* The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
* The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
* When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number and all the Crystals will have new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
* The app also keeps track of the number of games the player wins and loses.
